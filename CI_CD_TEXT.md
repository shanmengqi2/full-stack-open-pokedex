Let’s imagine a Python-based web application being developed by a team of six people. In a continuous integration (CI) setup for Python, some common steps include linting, testing, and building. For linting, tools like Flake8 or Pylint are popular—they check for syntax errors and enforce PEP8 coding standards. For testing, developers often use pytest, which supports simple test discovery and integrates well with coverage tools like coverage.py to measure code test coverage. If the application needs to be packaged or deployed, the build step might involve using setuptools or Poetry to create distributable artifacts such as Python wheels or Docker images.

Beyond Jenkins and GitHub Actions, there are several other CI options. GitLab CI/CD offers a tightly integrated pipeline system that works well with GitLab repositories. CircleCI and Travis CI are also widely used cloud-based solutions that are easy to configure with YAML files. For teams that value scalability and containerization, Drone CI or Buildkite can be strong alternatives, offering more flexibility for custom pipelines.

Whether to use a self-hosted or cloud-based setup depends on the organization’s priorities. A cloud-based CI is usually faster to set up and requires less maintenance, ideal for smaller teams or startups. A self-hosted CI, on the other hand, offers more control, security, and cost efficiency for large or regulated organizations. To make the decision, one would need information on security policies, budget, deployment infrastructure, and the sensitivity of the codebase or data involved.
